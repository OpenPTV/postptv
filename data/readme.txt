## Two phase experiment

# What's in the data

Data referenced here:
Guala M. et al, Experimentalstudy on clusteringoflarge particles in homogeneous
turbulent flow, Journal of Turbulence.

Here we have the first 200 frames of the 5/9 run 1 data. Tracer data and 
particles data were recorded simultaneously using two parallel recording 
systems.

Particles are SSA = small silica gel particles, not spherical (amorphous), 
diameter (D) = 400 - 500 micron, density (rho) = 1450 kg/m^3. Recording is at
500 fps, flow driven by rotating disks at 500 rpm.

# Formats

The inertial particles data are available in two formats: as a directory with
xuap-formatted files (particles/) and as an HDF5 file holding the particles
table (particles.h5). 

The tracers are also available in two formats, a ptv_is directory (tracers/)
and an HDF5 file (tracers.h5)
