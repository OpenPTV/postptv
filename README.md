Installation
-----------

To install this package, follow the standard procedure for installing 
Python modules. The package may be installed either system wide, in the default
location, or for a single user, by changing the install location and updating
environment variables in the standard way, as indicated by the Python 
documentation [1]. 

For a default system wide installation: using a terminal, change directory into
the root directory of this program's source code, then run

  pip install . -r requirements.txt

Note that for the default install you may need administrative privileges on the
machine you are using. Consult the Python documentation for the single-user 
install procedure.

The install script will install the Python package in the default place for 
your platform. Additionally, it will install example scripts in a 
subdirectory ``flowtracks-examples/`` under the default executable location, 
and a the documentation in the default package root. For information on where
these directories are on your platform (and how to change them), refer to 
the Python documentation [1]. Other standard features of the setup script are 
also described therein.

The examples are Jupyter notebooks [2], and can be previewed without any 
special setup under the examples section of
