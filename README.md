Flowtracks - postprocessing of 3D-PTV data
==========================================

This package contains Flowtracks, a Python-package for post-processing
of 3D Particle Tracking Velocimetry particle/trajectory databases.

The full documentation for this package may be built from the Sphinx 
sources in the doc/ directory. It is also available online:

  http://flowtracks.readthedocs.org

Please refer to that documentation for the full information on installing,
reference documentation and usage examples contained in the package.

The program is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public 
License, version 3.0. For details, see the LICENSE.txt file.

Getting Started
===============

Obtaining the package and its dependencies
------------------------------------------

The most recent version of this package may be found under the auspices of
the OpenPTV project, in its Github repository,

  https://github.com/OpenPTV/postptv

Dependencies:

* The software depends on the SciPy package, obtainable from 
  http://www.scipy.org/

* Some features depend on the Matplotlib package. Users which need those 
  features may get Matplotlib at http://matplotlib.org/

Installation
-----------

To install this package, follow the standard procedure for installing 
Python modules. The package may be installed either systemwide, in the default
location, or for a single user, by changing the install location and updating
environment variables in the standard way, as indicated by the Python 
documentation [1]. 

For a default systemwide installation: using a terminal, change directory into
the root directory of theis program's source code, then run

  python setup.py install

Note that for the default install you may need administrative privileges on the
machine you are using. Consult the Python documentation for the single-user 
install procedure.

The install script will install the Python package in the default place for 
your platform. Additionally, it will install example scripts in a 
subdirectory ``flowtracks-examples/`` under the default executable location, 
and a the documentation in the default package root. For information on where
these directories are on your platform (and how to change them), refer to 
the Python documentation [1]. Other standard features of the setup script are 
also described therein.

The examples are Jupyter notebooks [2], and can be previewed without any 
special setup under the examples section of

  http://flowtracks.readthedocs.org

PostPTV
=======

Post processing routines for analysing PTV data.

The OpenPTV software (www.openptv.net) produces few types of the ASCII files, the results of the identification, localization
(triangulation), correspondence (stereo-matching) and tracking procedures. 

The output of the first step of the image processing routines is the location of the particles in the images. These files are called _targets
and located in the `/img` folder


The stereo-matching and localization results are stored in the `rt_is.###` files where `###` is the number of the frame. 


The final result is the positions of the particles in the 3D space, linked together, called `ptv_is.###` files. The file format is
the single row header and 5 columns:

the header is the number of particles in the frame, N (i.e. the number of rows in the file)

The five columns are: 
`previous, next, x, y, z`

previous is the row number of the particle in the previous frame, counts from zero (i.e. first row -> previous = 0)
next is the row number in the next frame
x,y,z are in millimeters

if the particle has no link in the previous frame, then previous = -1
if the particle has no link in the next frame, then next = -2


See example of the `ptv_is` file in https://github.com/alexlib/postptv/blob/master/data/tracers/ptv_is.10001


There is a post-processing software, created by Beat Luethi that is available from https://github.com/3dptv/3d-ptv-post-process where 
the latest version is https://github.com/3dptv/3d-ptv-post-process/tree/master/version_January_2013 This software will get into OpenPTV 
but at the moment we can simply add Python codes that will visualize the results of the post-processing. The software creates files
that are named `xuap.###` (x for position, u for velocity, a for acceleration of the particles) and also `trajPoint.###`. The files are
explained on https://github.com/3dptv/3d-ptv-post-process/tree/master/version_January_2013 

The Python codes in this repository shall work equally well with any kind of Lagrangian trajectories (and maybe also other types), showing
the same types of figures and plots for `rt_is.###`, `ptv_is.###`, `xuap.###` or `trajPoint.###` files.
